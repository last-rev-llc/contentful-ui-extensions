* Tutorial

Upon loading the appropriate content model you should be greeted with something which looks similar to the following:

** General section
*** Form type
gives us the ability to select the form provider (where will the data get sent)
Upon selecting specific providers we'll be able to input a formId or portalId (hubspot)

*** Edit & Copy buttons
The edit button allows to manually edit the JSON, this is an advanced feature as it can be easy
to make a mistake while manually editing the form data.

The copy button copies the raw JSON from the form to enable ease of pasting to another content model.

** Form Setup section

This is the real meat of our form builder software.
The following image gives a breakdown of the components:

*** Creating a step
Clicking "Add step" adds a template step which can be edited by clicking anywhere on the main body of the step.

Steps can have ~dependsOn~ logic, please see the appropriate section

*** Creating a field
Clicking the small plus button below the last field adds a template field which can be edited by clicking anywhere on the main body of the field.

Fields by default have the following attributes:
 - Label (what will be displayed to the user)
 - Key (where the value will be saved in the formState)
 - Type (which type of field to render to the user)

Fields can have ~dependsOn~ logic, please see the appropriate section
