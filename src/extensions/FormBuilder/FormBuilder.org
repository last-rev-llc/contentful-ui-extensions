** General section
*** Form type
gives us the ability to select the form provider (where will the data get sent)
Upon selecting specific providers we'll be able to input a formId or portalId (hubspot)

*** Edit & Copy buttons
The edit button allows to manually edit the JSON, this is an advanced feature as it can be easy

The copy button copies the raw JSON from the form to enable ease of pasting to another content model.

** Form Setup section
