# Last Rev UI Extension Library

A collection of UI Extensions for Contentful like a Color picker, SEO, Categories and more.

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:last-rev-llc/contentful-ui-extensions.git
```

### Install Dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

OR

```shell
yarn install
```

### Start the application

```shell
npm start
```

### Running Locally

In order to help streamline the process of development we have created a mock SDK that allows you to run the extensions locally with hot reload. You can also use this to see mock examples of the expected response from Contentful and data structure or objects.

#### Open the browser

> [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

This will be a list of all available UI Extensions.

### Using Netlify Lambda Functions
Some UI Extensions, especially ones that integrate with third party services will need to communicate using a serverless function. We use Netlify for hosting and below are the instructions to run them locally

First you need to install the [Netlify CLI Tools](https://github.com/netlify/cli)
> npm install netlify-cli -g

To start the application use the following command instead of `npm start`. This starts a node server as well as your React application
> ntl dev

Creating a new function
> netlify functions:create *function-name*

Functions are located in the `/lambda` folder located in the project root directory. This is defined in the `netlify.toml` file

**Notes on Functions:**
- You mush specify the headers in the return. For instance you must specify `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to prevent CORS issues
- You must include any dependencies you use in your Lambda functions in the main package.json
- Environment Variables must be set in the Netlify UI and are availalbe locally when running `ntl dev`

### Using in Contentful

To see the extension in your Contentful instance follow the directions below for each extension.
> When running locally you will need to allow "unsafe" scripts to be allowed. This is because you run localhost with http and since Contentful injects it using an iFrame browsers will block them by default.
